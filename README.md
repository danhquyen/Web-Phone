## Overview

Siperb's Web-Phone is a lightweight JavaScript SDK that powers open‑source Web Phone / Browser Phone applications. It securely retrieves user session, devices, and SIP provisioning (username, password, domain, WSS/WebSocket) from the Siperb API so you can bootstrap a WebRTC softphone in minutes. Use it to initialize SIP.js, JsSIP, or your own VoIP client with consistent, secure provisioning flows — in both browser and module environments, with optional caching for performance. Once installed in your CRM, Website, ERP, Saas or Intranet - you can enable powerful [click to dial](https://www.web-phone.org/click-to-dial/) features.

## Features

- Modern dual build: ESM and UMD (minified)
- Works in both browser (global `window.SiperbAPI`) and module projects
- Simple promise-based API: Login → Devices → Provisioning
- Optional caching with localStorage
- Battle-tested examples with SIP.js and JsSIP
- CDN-ready for quick prototypes and demos

## Who is this for?

- Teams building an open‑source Web/Browser Phone or embedded Phones in SaaS/CRM
- Developers integrating a WebRTC softphone (VoIP) using SIP.js or JsSIP
- Contact centers and PWAs that need secure SIP provisioning over WSS
- Anyone who wants a simple SDK to automate device provisioning and login flows
- Projects migrating desk phone provisioning into a modern, browser‑based softphone

## Quick Start
Refer to API Docs here [API](docs/README.md)

### In the Browser
Include the minified bundle from the CDN in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.siperb.com/lib/Siperb-Web-Phone/Web-Phone-<VERSION_NUMBER>.umd.min.js"></script>
```

### As a Module (ESM)

```js
import Siperb from './dist/Siperb-Web-Phone.esm.min.js';
```

## Typical Usage Sequence

1. **Login**: Authenticate with your access token to obtain a session token and user ID.
2. **GetDevices** (optional): Retrieve the list of devices associated with the user (optionally using caching). This step is not essential if you already have your DeviceToken (e.g., from the Admin Control Panel).
3. **GetProvisioning**: Fetch provisioning details for a specific device, including SIP credentials and settings (optionally using caching). You can call this directly after ```Login``` if you know your DeviceToken.

**Note:** If you already have your DeviceToken (for example, from the Siperb Admin Control Panel), you can skip GetDevices and call GetProvisioning immediately after ```Login```. This is useful for automated scripts or when provisioning a known device.

This sequence allows a user to securely obtain all information needed to configure a SIP client or device.

## API Reference

### Siperb.Login(pat)
**Parameters:**
- `pat` (string): Your Siperb Personal Access Token (PAT) (from Admin Control Panel).

**Returns:**
- `Promise<Object>`: Resolves with a session object containing at least `SessionToken` and `UserId`.

**Side Effects:**
 Sets `window.SiperbAPI.SESSION_TOKEN` and `window.SiperbAPI.USER_ID` in the browser.

**Errors:**
- Rejects the promise if authentication fails or the API is unreachable.

**Example:**
```js
const session = await Siperb.Login('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');
console.log(session.SessionToken, session.UserId);
```

### Siperb.GetDevices(options)
**Parameters:**
- `options` (object):
	- `UserId` (string): The user ID (from ```Login```)
	- `SessionToken` (string): The session token (from ```Login```)
	- `EnableCache` (boolean, optional): Whether to use localStorage caching
	- `SessionKey` (string, optional): The cache key for devices

**Returns:**
- `Promise<Object|Array>`: Resolves with the user's devices (array or object, depending on API).

**Side Effects:**
 Sets `window.SiperbAPI.DEVICES` in the browser.

**Errors:**
- Always resolves; returns `null` or empty array on error or forbidden.

**Example:**
```js
const devices = await Siperb.GetDevices({
	UserId: session.UserId,
	SessionToken: session.SessionToken,
	EnableCache: true,
	SessionKey: 'SiperbDevices'
});
console.log(devices);
```

### Siperb.GetProvisioning(options)
**Parameters:**
- `options` (object):
	- `UserId` (string): The user ID (from ```Login```)
	- `DeviceToken` (string): The device token (from a device in GetDevices)
	- `SessionToken` (string): The session token (from ```Login```)
	- `EnableCache` (boolean, optional): Whether to use localStorage caching
	- `ProvisioningKey` (string, optional): The cache key for provisioning

**Returns:**
- `Promise<Object>`: Resolves with provisioning details, including SIP username, password, and settings.

**Side Effects:**
 Sets `window.SiperbAPI.PROVISIONING` in the browser.

**Errors:**
- Always resolves; returns `null` on error or forbidden.

**Example:**
```js
const provisioning = await Siperb.GetProvisioning({
	UserId: session.UserId,
	DeviceToken: device.DeviceToken,
	SessionToken: session.SessionToken,
	EnableCache: true,
	ProvisioningKey: 'SiperbProvisioning'
});
console.log(provisioning.SipUsername, provisioning.SipPassword);
```

### SIP.js Example

[Using SIP.js](./test-SIPJS.html)

### JsSIP Example 

[Using JsSIP](./test-JSSIP.html)


These examples show how to:
- Register with the SIP server using provisioned credentials
- Always use a static contact (ContactUserName)
- Make outbound calls with custom headers for session and user identification

- **Security**: Handles authentication and session management securely.
- **Convenience**: Provides a simple, promise-based API for all provisioning steps.
- **Caching**: Optional localStorage caching for performance and offline support.
- **Browser & Module Support**: Works in both browser and modern JS module environments.
- **Extensible**: Easily add more API calls or extend caching logic as needed.


# Full Browser Phone Example

- [Codepen Eample](https://codepen.io/siperb/pen/myrOdap) (https://codepen.io/siperb/pen/myrOdap)

- [Siperb Web Phone](./test-Browser-Phone.html)

This repository includes a fully usable, IFRAME‑based Browser Phone that you can embed into any web app. It follows the same secure flow described above: Login → (optional) GetDevices → GetProvisioning → Initialize Phone. The UI, logic, and media assets are loaded on demand from the Siperb CDN and initialized inside your own IFRAME.

Why an IFRAME?
- The phone UI ships with its own HTML, CSS, and JS. Loading it in an IFRAME isolates styles and scripts from your app and ensures responsive behavior across screen sizes.
- The smallest supported footprint is ~320×320 px; 400×640 (or larger) is recommended. Fullscreen is supported.

How it works (high level)
1) Authenticate with your Personal Access Token (PAT) to obtain a SessionToken and UserId.
2) Obtain provisioning for a specific DeviceToken (from Admin Control Panel → Script device).
3) Create an IFRAME (src="about:blank") and call `SiperbAPI.LoadBrowserPhone(frame)` to load the UI from CDN.
4) Call `SiperbAPI.ProvisionPhone(...)` with your provisioning + session to configure SIP and bring the phone online.

Under the hood
- `LoadBrowserPhone(iframe)` fetches a version tree and loads the phone’s HTML, CSS, and JS from the Siperb CDN into the IFRAME’s document.
- `ProvisionPhone(options)` wires up storage, media, UI, and the SIP provider using your provisioning:
	- WSS endpoint: `SipWssServer` + `SipWebsocketPort` + `SipServerPath`
	- SIP auth: `SipUsername` / `SipPassword` / `SipDomain`
	- Static contact: `SipContact` (ContactUserName)
	- Custom headers: `X-Siperb-Sid`, `X-Siperb-Uid` for call requests

Requirements & notes
- Requires Internet access to the Siperb CDN; offline is not supported for the Browser Phone (use Desktop Phone for offline scenarios).
- If your environment uses strict egress controls, whitelist the Siperb CDN domains.
- The IFRAME must be dedicated to the phone (don’t attempt to inject the phone UI into a DIV on your page).

# Click To Dial

Once installed, the phone can both accept and originate calls. Calls may also be initiated programmatically, enabling "[click to call](https://www.web-phone.org/click-to-dial/)" (also known as "[click to dial](https://www.web-phone.org/click-to-dial/)") functionality directly from your application or web page..
